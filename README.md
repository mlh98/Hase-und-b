# TE-Dependence-of-IVIM-in-the-Kidney
This respiratory contains all the data and evaluation used for the PlosOne manuscript "Echo time dependence of magnetic resonance biexponential intravoxel incoherent motion parameters in the kidney".

Measurements and segmentations as nifti-files, Python scripts for data processing, evaluation and plotting the figures as well as the biophysical multi-compartment modeling.

To run the code, please extract the zip files "Results IVIM Parameters.zip" and "Data and Segmentation.zip". Ensure that the extracted folders are placed at the top level of the main directory, e.g., folder "Data and Segmentation" is on the same level as the .py Scripts "Figure 2.py", "Figure 3.py", etc.

For more details on the methods, please refer to the manuscript.
